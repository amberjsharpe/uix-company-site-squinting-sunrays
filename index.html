            <h1>About Our Company</h1>
            <p>Here at Honey Health Inc., we provide only the highest quality honey 
                for all of your weight loss needs. Our  beekeepers, located in Toronto, 
                have a life time of experience in both the care of the bees and
                the harvesting of their honey. What is our secret you ask? Well, its no
                secret at all. It's a well known fact that happy bees produe the best
                honey. With this in mind, we spray our bees with a 100% Zoloft vapor
                every 6 hours, ensuring that their serotonin is well balanced and that
                they keep on working hard to make the very same honey that shows up at your door.
            </p>

            <p> We are also extremely proud of our extensive quality control department.
            We pay them the big bucks in order for them to examine each batch of honey,
            making sure there are no contaminants. If they do find any contaminants, we
            dispose of the batch and order an extermination by incineration of the responsible
            hive. We do this with our customers in mind.  </p>

            <p>Thanks to the support of our loyal customers, we now provide international shipping.
                We also ship to remote places by means of drone-transportation. This means animated
                bears living in the forest will be able to receive their shipment of honey with 
                the click of a button. We are also working with Amazon to soon provide "Prime Shipping."
                Please tell your friends and family about our project to help us continue to grow!

            <h2>Check Out Our Honey App!!!</h2>

                <p>Our new HoneyHealth app is now available for both ios and android. We are also 
                aware that honey might be counter-productive for your weight-loss goals. Although, we 
                don't believe that one should be forced to abstain from honey altogether, so we made
                a fun adventure based game available on the app store. Here's how it works: your friend
                will hide your honey, mark the location on the app, and send you an invite. Now it's your
                turn. The app will give you a very broad hint and general location about where he or
                 she has hidden your honey. The more you walk, the more the map will zoom in on where
                 the hidden honey treasure is. Once you reach a mile of walking, our app will show you
                 the exact pinpoint of our delicious golden honey. Happy Hunting, and look out for bears!
                </p>
                <h2>Buy Our New Honey Bit!!!</h2>
                <p>Now featured on our app, is the ability to connect to our Honey Bit! The honey bit is a tool
                    to effectively lose weight or atleast keep the figure you've worked so hard on maintaining!
                    Simply put the Honey Bit on your wrist and adjust your preferences in the app. Now your app will
                    alert you once you've reached your daily honey limit. At this point, it will give you
                    the ability to unlock more honey, by performing aerobic activy that is demonstrated 
                    right there on your phone! If you like our Honey Bit, please leave a positive review!
